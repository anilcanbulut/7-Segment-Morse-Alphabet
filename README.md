# 7-Segment-Morse-Alphabet
In this project, I've built a "Morse Alphabet" encoder-decoder code. As I said, this bunch of code provides the user encryption and decryption at the same time. Have fun with this awesome project.

I've used: 
- STM32L073 Nucleo-64 card 
- 2 push buttons
- One 7 segment display
- 1 Buzzer
- 2 LEDs and resistors for them.

##This project is written in the Mbed Online platform, but you may also want to change the code to use it in Keil which I also highly recommend it.
